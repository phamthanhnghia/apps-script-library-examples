# üìö Google Apps Script Library Examples

This repository contains comprehensive and enhanced examples of using various Google Apps Script libraries. Each folder now features improved scripts demonstrating practical, real-world usage, complete with detailed explanations, modern JavaScript practices, and robust error handling.

## ‚ú® What's New & Improved

This repository has undergone a significant overhaul to provide more valuable and runnable examples:

-   **Workflow-Oriented Examples**: Many directories (e.g., `SpreadsheetApp`, `DriveApp`, `DocumentApp`, `FormApp`, `CalendarApp`) now feature single, comprehensive workflow scripts. These scripts demonstrate end-to-end processes (e.g., building a full report, managing calendar events, processing email attachments) that are self-contained and require no manual setup or hardcoded IDs.
-   **Enhanced Individual Scripts**: For services where a single workflow wasn't appropriate (e.g., `GmailApp`, `UrlFetchApp`, `ScriptApp`), individual scripts have been significantly improved with:
    *   Detailed JSDoc comments for better understanding.
    *   Modern JavaScript syntax (ES6+).
    *   Robust error handling (`try...catch`).
    *   More practical and illustrative use cases.
    *   Clearer logging and verification steps.
-   **Consolidated Demonstrations**: Services like `Logger` and `PropertiesService` now feature single, well-documented scripts that comprehensively demonstrate all their core functionalities and different scopes.
-   **Clearer `HtmlService` Examples**: The `HtmlService` examples have been refactored into distinct, runnable demonstrations covering web apps, sidebars with data exchange, styled modal dialogs, and embedded charts.

## üéØ How to Use

1. **Open Google Apps Script**:  
   - Open a Google Workspace app (e.g., Google Sheets, Docs).
   - Navigate to **Extensions > Apps Script**.

2. **Copy the Code**:  
   - Browse the examples in the desired library folder.
   - Copy the code into the Apps Script editor.
   - **Important**: For workflow examples, copy the entire `.gs` file. For `HtmlService` examples, copy both the `.gs` file and the embedded HTML content (if applicable) into separate `.html` files in your Apps Script project, or directly into the `.gs` file as shown in the examples.

3. **Test and Execute**:  
   Customize and run the code in your Google Workspace environment. Ensure you grant any necessary permissions when prompted.
